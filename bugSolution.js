The solution involves using a cleanup function within the useEffect hook to explicitly set the ref to null or undefined after the component unmounts. This prevents any potential access to the ref after its associated component is removed from the DOM.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // ... some logic that might use myRef ...
    return () => {
      // Cleanup function: explicitly set the ref to null 
      myRef.current = null;  
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Some Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
This ensures that any attempts to access `myRef.current` after unmount will safely return `null` preventing errors.
