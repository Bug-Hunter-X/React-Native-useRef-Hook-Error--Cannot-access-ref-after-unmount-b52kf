This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native, specifically when trying to access the current value of a ref after unmounting a component.  This results in a runtime error because the ref's current value is no longer accessible after the component has been unmounted from the React Native tree.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // ... some logic that uses myRef ...
    return () => {
      // cleanup function, but myRef might be accessed AFTER this
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Some Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
